# Stock-Price-Prediction-Model-LSTM
The code is implementing a long-short term memory algorithm using a neural net.

### the data comes from the following websites:

NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset: https://data.nasdaq.com/data/NSE/TATAGLOBAL-tata-global-beverages-limited

Stock prices: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierpaolo28/Data-Visualization/master/Dash/stock_data.csv

### Considerations:

The code is based on knowledge from:

https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-stock-price-prediction-project-code/

Nevertheless, I modify and alter the cod eto create a personal version of this implementation.
